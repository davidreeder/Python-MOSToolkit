## MOSOSC Demo


Include path to `Python-MOSToolkit/classes/` directory in `PYTHONPATH`.  MOSToolKit assumes Python v3.

Run OSCServer and OSCClient in two separate windows:

    First:
      $ ./OSCServer.py  2>/dev/null

    Then:
      $ ./OSCClient.py


Review comments in both OSCClient.py and OSCServer.py for additional examples of class features.


See [MOSOSC.py](https://github.com/davidreeder/Python-MOSToolkit/blob/main/classes/MOSOSC.py) class header and "pydoc MOSOSC" for further details.
